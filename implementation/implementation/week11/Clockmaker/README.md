# üåí The Clockmaker‚Äôs Paradox
**Theme:** A mysterious Clockmaker‚Äôs Workshop 
where every clock measures a different kind of time 
‚Äî lunar, dream, human, or mechanical.
But the clocks begin desynchronizing, 
and only the master algorithm can recalibrate them.

---

## üß© Focus Areas
* **Abstract classes** & inheritance
* **Polymorphism** (different tick behaviors)
* **Interfaces** (Repairable, Synchronizable)
* **Enums** (ClockType, Status)
* **Encapsulation** & exception handling

---

## üèóÔ∏è Task
Design a small system where each clock ticks differently and may break over time.
A ClockManager will try to keep all clocks synchronized.

### Classes & Interfaces
1. Abstract class _Clock_
    - Fields: String name, ClockType type, int health
    - Methods: abstract void tick(), boolean isBroken(), void repair()
    - Implements Repairable
2. Enum _ClockType_
    - Values: LUNAR, DREAM, HUMAN, MECHANICAL
3. Interface _Repairable_
    - Method: void repair()
4. Interface _Synchronizable_
    - Method: void synchronize(Clock other) throws SyncException 
5. Custom Exception _SyncException_
    - Thrown when two clocks cannot synchronize due to large ‚Äútime drift‚Äù.
6. Concrete Classes _LunarClock_, _DreamCLock_, _HumanClock_, _MechanicalClock_
    - Each implements tick() differently ‚Äî e.g. random drift or unique messages.
    - Optionally override toString() for pretty output.
7. Manager _ClockManager_
    - Holds a List<Clock>
    - Method simulateDay():
      - Each clock ticks.
      - Randomly tries to synchronize some pairs.
      - If synchronization fails ‚Üí catches SyncException and repairs the weaker clock.

### üèÖ Final Grade: 10 / 10
#### üåô Summary
You‚Äôre absolutely ready for the OOP2 exam.
You understand inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, abstraction, enums, and exception handling ‚Äî and you can express them both clearly and creatively.
The design quality is at a level that can easily earn you a distinction or top 5% score.
