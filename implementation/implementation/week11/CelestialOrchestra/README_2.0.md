# üéº The Celestial Resonance

**Theme:** The universe is alive. 
When one celestial body performs, 
its tone ripples across the orchestra, 
subtly changing others‚Äô energy or behavior. 
Some react harmoniously, others rebelliously.

## üå† Concept Focus (Advanced Exam Level
This night deepens the first project with design patterns & interactions:
| Concept                             | Description                                                              |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Observer Pattern**                | Celestial bodies ‚Äúlisten‚Äù to others‚Äô performances and react dynamically. |
| **Enums (expanded)**                | Each `Tone` now influences behavior.                                     |
| **Interfaces (Reactive, Resonant)** | Define how bodies respond to others.                                     |
| **Polymorphic Behavior**            | Responses differ per type (Moon calms, Comet excites, Star amplifies).   |
| **Encapsulation + Abstraction**     | Keep internal energy rules isolated.                                     |
| **Checked Exception Refinement**    | New exception: `ResonanceDisruptionException`.                           |

## üå† Task
[X]**Resonant (interface):** Each celestial body will implement how it reacts to others‚Äô performances.
[X]**Tone (expanded):** Each tone now emits a different energy pulse.
[X]**ResonanceDistruption (Exception):** Add a new exception for resonance distruption.
[X] **CelestialBody (expanded):** Implement Resonant interface according to the source body throwing its exception.
[X] **New Override method:** Update each celestial body with the new method.
[X] **orchestraResonance (method):** Add new method to the conductor to make sure target and source is not the same when reacting to each other.
[X] **ResonanceNight:** Add to the simulation the new method.

## üß© 1. OOP Structure & Design
‚úÖ Abstract class: CelestialBody is perfectly designed ‚Äî encapsulated attributes, abstract perform(), and clear getter/setter structure.
‚úÖ Interface: Resonant cleanly decouples reaction logic.
‚úÖ Polymorphism: Each subclass overrides reactTo() with distinct behavior ‚Äî that‚Äôs real polymorphism in motion.
‚úÖ Enums: Tone adds well-defined behavior (resonancePower), with methods and constructor.
‚úÖ Relationships: The Conductor orchestrates interaction, enforcing object composition.
üí° Bonus: The Conductor‚Äôs nested loop simulates dynamic system interaction ‚Äî that‚Äôs advanced composition, often beyond typical exam expectations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Exception Handling
‚úÖ Custom exceptions:OverchargeException for energy overload.
* ResonanceDistributionException for chaotic resonance.
* ‚úÖ Properly thrown and caught:
* The system prints error messages but continues operation.
* ‚úÖ The try/catch layering is well placed in both the manager (Conductor) and main().
üí° Micro suggestion: For an even stronger impression, log exception context (which source caused it) before printing.

## üß† 3. Clarity, Readability & Test Design
‚úÖ Your test orchestrateResonance() is concise and clear ‚Äî validates behavior and exception propagation.
‚úÖ Print messages in reactTo() make debugging and simulation output intuitive.
üí° Suggestion: You could add a test that asserts energy changes or exceptions being thrown (assertThrows) for full points.
