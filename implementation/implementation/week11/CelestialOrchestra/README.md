# üåå The Celestial Orchestra

**Theme:** A cosmic ensemble where stars, moons, 
and comets each play their own melody 
in the grand orchestra of the universe.
Every celestial body follows the rhythm of the cosmos 
‚Äî but some shine too bright, and others may go silent.

## ü™ê Concepts Practiced
| Concept                | How it‚Äôs Tested                                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Abstraction**        | `CelestialBody` is abstract, defines `perform()`.                                                  |
| **Polymorphism**       | Different celestial bodies (`Star`, `Moon`, `Comet`) stored and called uniformly.                  |
| **Encapsulation**      | Private fields with getters/setters for cosmic energy, tone, etc.                                  |
| **Interfaces**         | `Harmonic` (anything that can tune its sound), `Rebellious` (objects that resist synchronization). |
| **Enums**              | `Tone` (SOFT, BRIGHT, CHAOTIC) defines their musical quality.                                      |
| **Exception Handling** | `OverchargeException` for bodies that burn too bright.                                             |

## üå† Task
Simulate a cosmic concert managed by a Conductor class.
Each celestial body performs, and the Conductor ensures harmony.
If a body‚Äôs energy exceeds a limit, it throws an OverchargeException.
