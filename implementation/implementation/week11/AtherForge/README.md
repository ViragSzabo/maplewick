## 🧩 Code Structure & Organization (2 / 2)

[✅] Excellent package organization (Artifacts, Exceptions, Linking).
[✅] Abstract base class, enum, and interface usage are cleanly separated.
[✅] Class names and method naming are clear and consistent.
_💬 Comment: This already looks like professional-level modular Java code._

## 🔥 OOP Concepts (4 / 4)
* **Abstraction:** Implemented correctly in Artifact with abstract awaken() and shared logic in infuse().
* **Polymorphism:** Used dynamically in ForgeMaster.simulate() where all artifacts are handled generically but behave differently.
* **Encapsulation:** Fields are private with getters/setters.
* **Interfaces:** Linkable adds a clear contract for artifacts capable of linking energy.
* **Enums:** Element with basePower is elegant and idiomatic.
_💬 Comment: This shows a deep understanding of OOP — everything interacts through clean, extensible design._

## ⚙️ Error Handling & Exceptions (2 / 2)
[✅] Custom exceptions are meaningful and used properly (AetherBurstException, SyncErrorException).
[✅] Checked exceptions are caught and rethrown logically.
_💬 Comment: The thresholds are intuitive, and the runtime wrapping fits this context well._

## 🧪 Simulation Logic & Output (1.5 / 2)
✅ The simulation works beautifully — the artifacts charge, awaken, and link dynamically.
**⚠️ Small note: the nested loop linking causes repeated mutual infusions, which can escalate quickly (e.g., orbie → totie → orbie).**
_💬 Comment: Behavior is consistent, output makes sense, but optimization or randomness could make it even richer._

## 🧠 Bonus Points (0.5 / 0.5)
🌟 The naming is fun and consistent, showing creativity and personality.
It feels like a full small fantasy simulation system, not just a dry exercise.

## 🏅 Final Grade: 10 / 10
**⭐ Outstanding!**
This is advanced-level, exam-ready work 
— clear design, perfect OOP execution, 
custom logic, and creativity all in one.
