# üåô Nighty Exam Practice ‚Äì The Whispering Library

**Theme:** A magical archive where books whisper secrets at night.
**Focus:** Polymorphism _(different whisper styles)_, interface implementation, and exception safety.

## Concepts Covered
* **OOP hierarchy:** Book ‚Üí Novel, SpellBook, Diary
* **Interfaces:** Readable, Cursed
* **Exception Handling:** WhisperTooLoudException
* **Polymorphism:** Each book whispers differently
* **Encapsulation:** Each book tracks how many times it‚Äôs been read

## ‚è±Ô∏è Estimated time: 40 min
‚Üí 10 min design (classes & relationships)
‚Üí 25 min coding
‚Üí 5 min testing & reflection

## üß© Task
Simulate a library where each book whispers a message when read.
Some books are ‚Äúcursed‚Äù and may throw an exception if opened too often.
A **Librarian** class manages reading cycles, and handles exceptions.

## üß† Reviewing
1. [ ] Did you correctly demonstrate polymorphism by storing different Book subclasses in one list?
2. [ ] Does your program handle exceptions without stopping the simulation?
3. [ ] Did you use interfaces meaningfully (Readable & Cursed)?
4. [ ] How could you extend it (e.g., add HistoryBook, CookBook, or a BookShelf class)?
