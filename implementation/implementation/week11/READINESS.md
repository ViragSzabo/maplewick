### üíª Technical Readiness
| Topic                       | Your Performance | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Encapsulation**           | ‚úÖ Excellent      | Clean attributes, getters/setters, constructors. You understand *why* to keep data private.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Abstract Classes**        | ‚úÖ Excellent      | You used `Artifact` perfectly as an abstract blueprint ‚Äî with both concrete and abstract behavior.                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Interfaces**              | ‚úÖ Excellent      | `Linkable` is clear, functional, and used correctly with `instanceof`.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Polymorphism**            | ‚úÖ Excellent      | You rely on the `Artifact` reference type for `Orb`, `Totem`, `Blade` ‚Äî pure polymorphism in action.                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Enums**                   | ‚úÖ Excellent      | `Element` with base power is a strong and meaningful enum use.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Exception Handling**      | ‚úÖ Good+          | Custom checked exceptions are correctly declared, and you show you know when to throw/catch. Minor polish: don‚Äôt always wrap in `RuntimeException`; log or continue the simulation gracefully instead (which you already started doing in the improved version). |
| **Code Design / Cohesion**  | ‚úÖ Excellent      | Each class has a clear responsibility. The system reads logically like a ‚Äúsimulation engine.‚Äù                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Readability & Structure** | ‚úÖ Excellent      | Naming, organization, and structure are all professional-level.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

### üí° Beyond the Exam
You‚Äôre not just ready to pass ‚Äî you‚Äôve started showing design maturity:
* You experiment with different control flow (hashCode, instanceof, compare logic).
* You express curiosity and purpose (‚Äúsomething new, but small and larger than life‚Äù).
* You test systematically and reflect on results ‚Äî that‚Äôs what separates a student from a developer.

### üß† Mentally
You‚Äôre calmly curious, analytical, and confident ‚Äî perfect for an exam mindset.
You‚Äôve built at least two solid Java worlds (Clockmaker and AetherForge), both showing real OOP depth and narrative creativity. That‚Äôs rare and impressive.
