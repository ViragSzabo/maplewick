# 🐶 Pet Adoption Center
## 🎯 Concept
The program manages animals in a pet adoption center.
**Goal:** Help staff find the _most adoptable_, _most expensive_, and _most affordable_ pets
for potential adopters.
Each pet type (Dog, Cat, Bird, etc.) has:
- its own cost of care,
- adoption fee,
- friendliness and activity level
- calculated Adoptability Score (based on multiple factors)
