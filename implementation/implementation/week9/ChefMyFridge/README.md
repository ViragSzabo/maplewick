# 🍳 Chef & My Fridge

_A smart kitchen management system for creative home chefs._

## 🎯 Concept Overview

The Chef & My Fridge application simulates a personal kitchen assistant 
that helps manage ingredients, track expiry dates, and suggest recipes 
based on what’s in the fridge.

It demonstrates:
* OOP design (inheritance, abstraction, composition)
* Custom exceptions
* Enums for ingredient types or categories
* Use of collections (List, Map)
* Filtering, sorting, and comparisons (e.g., freshness, quantity)
* Interfaces for “cookable” or “storable” behaviour

🧠 Exam Focus Points

* **OOP design:** abstract base class + concrete subclasses
* **Collections:** ArrayList, filtering, sorting
* **Exceptions:** Fridge full or ingredient not found
* **Enums:** Ingredient categories
* **Interface:** Optional for cookability
* **Streams:** Finding freshest, expired, etc.
